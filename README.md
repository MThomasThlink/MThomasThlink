My name is Marcelo Thomas and even though I'm an Electric Engineer, I've been working with software and firmware development for a loong time.
C, Java, smart cards and SQL are the areas where I have more experience but part of my work is exactly design, develop and deploy efficient solutions for real life applications (currently in Ticketing for mass transport). 
That translates into firmware development for Linux based validators and other equipments as POS, communication between a Java based server and a large quantity of devices, acquiring and processing geopositional information, displaying information for the public using Raspberry Pi, a reliable and efficient distributed recharge system for the user card (including inside the bus), payment detection (using the brazilian PIX) and even a mobile (Android) app where the driver receives and sends information to a control room.

Other then development, part of my job is searching, testing and validating third party products and software (as a Facial Recognition System API) and integrating it with the ticketing system.

It's been quite a ride so far. 
My native language is portuguese but I can express myself confidently in English and Italian.
